# hello-world-2

It's tutorial time again (January 3rd, 2017)

On the previous line, "Preview changes" shows an extra closing parenthesis if I end the line with a period.

Putting parentheses around a phrase (like here) works fine, unless the closing parenthesis is followed by a period (like this).  But it's only a problem on the first line of text after the first header line.

Eventually, I'll store my Mooers Lab scripts and documents here.

Testing *emphasis*, **bold**, _underline_, ~~strikethrough~~, `code`.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Underline</span> with inline CSS?  No.  According to [Do \<style\> tags work in Markdown?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20598628/do-style-tags-work-in-markdown):

> *GitHub strips style tags and attributes preventing you from changing the style on their pages. This is probably for security reasons. If you could inject css into GitHub pages, you could easily launch a phishing attack.*

U&#x332;n&#x332;d&#x332;e&#x332;r&#x332;l&#x332;i&#x332;n&#x332;e&#x332; by putting `&#x332;` after *each* character.

To paste into this editing window, use ctrl-v instead of shift-ins.  This is probably a problem with Ubuntu instead of Github.
